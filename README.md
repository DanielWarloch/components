# The Goal & Current Plan
A first-class styled, ARIA-compatible, cross-platform, component library for Dioxus.

todo

### `dioxus-components`

Nothing is currently set in stone but this may be a wrapper crate around multiple component libraries or a completely custom component library for Dioxus.

### `dioxus-aria`

An ARIA-compatible headless component library that provides functionality for all ARIA patterns found [here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/). 
All other component libraries found here will be built off of `dioxus-aria`.
